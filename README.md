To input notes, first select one of the 16 steps you would like to edit in the sequencer grid. Then, use the piano to activate a note and adjust the energy. Click and drag on a key to adjust the energy of that note or double click to toggle maximum energy/deactivate. When the step becomes active, notes with high energy have a greater probability of being selected to play (out of all the activated notes for that step).
